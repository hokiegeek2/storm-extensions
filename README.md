Extensions to Apache Storm

These are utility classes I've written that are extensions to the awesome Apache Storm streaming framework.

One area of focus in Jan-Feb 2016 will be to write custom scheduler logic that will work in both bare-metal and Storm Mesos clusters.

Another area under development utilizes the blazingly fast and versatile Redis product to write and cache configuration and monitoring content.
